# TallyBars

This is a productivity Android App. You can create lists of items and tally how many times you achieve each item on the list. 

Increment an item's tally by tapping once. Decrement a tally with a long press on the item.

## Comparing Tallies

Compare items in a list with the built in bar graph and 'balanced' and 'total' modes (where 'Balanced' only shows the relative differences in
tally counts between items).
