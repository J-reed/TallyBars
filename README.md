# TallyBars

This is a productivity Android App. You create lists and can tally how many times you achieve each item on the list. 
Compare items in a list with the built in bar graph and use 'balanced' mode to show only the relative differences in
tally counts between items.

Increment an item's tally by tapping once. Decrement a tally with a long press on the item.

Delete items with a swipe to the left.
